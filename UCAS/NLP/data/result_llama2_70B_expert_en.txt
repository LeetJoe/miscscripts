Who have acted in not only a movie that Tom Hanks has acted in but also a movie that Tom Cruise has acted in? Please list their names, the name of the movie he/she co-acted in with Tom Hanks, and the name of the movie he/she co-acted in with Tom Cruise.

 MATCH (a:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(b:Actor)
WHERE a.name = 'Tom Hanks' AND b.name = 'Tom Cruise'
RETURN a.name AS actor1, m.title AS movie1, b.name AS actor2, m.title AS movie2

MATCH (d:Director)-[:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(c:Director)
WHERE d.name = 'Tom Hanks' AND c.name = 'Tom Cruise'
RETURN d.name AS director1, m.title AS movie1, c.name AS director2, m.title AS movie2



Of all the actors in the movies that Tom Hanks has appeared in, the names of all the actors (excluding Tom Hanks) who have appeared with them in the same movie, and the number of times each has appeared in these movies? Please list the results in reverse order of the number of the times.

Here's the transformed Cypher query:
```cypher
WITH movies = Movie
WHERE ACTED_IN.actor IN (SELECT name FROM Actor WHERE ACTED_IN.movie = movies.title)
AND ACTED_IN.director = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN DISTINCT ACTED_IN.actor, COUNT(*) AS numAppearances
ORDER BY numAppearances DESC;
```
Explanation:

1. The first line `WITH movies = Movie` introduces a new named variable `movies` that refers to the `Movie` node.
2. The second line `WHERE ACTED_IN.actor IN (SELECT name FROM Actor WHERE ACTED_IN.movie = movies.title)` filters the movies to only those where at least one actor has appeared in a movie directed by Tom Hanks.
3. The third line `AND ACTED_IN.director = 'Tom Hanks'` filters the actors to only those who have appeared in a movie directed by Tom Hanks.
4. The fourth line `RETURN DISTINCT ACTED_IN.actor, COUNT(*) AS numAppearances` returns the names of all actors (excluding Tom Hanks) who have appeared in the same movie as Tom Hanks, along with the number of times they have appeared in these movies. The `COUNT(*)` function counts the number of occurrences of each actor in the filtered movies.
5. The fifth line `ORDER BY numAppearances DESC` sorts the results in reverse order of the number of appearances.

Explanation:

* `MATCH` clause finds the paths from an actor to a movie and then to a director, using the `ACTED_IN` and `DIRECTED` relationships. The director's name is restricted to "Tom Hanks".
* `RETURN` clause specifies the output, which includes the list of actors (excluding Tom Hanks) who have appeared in the same movies as Tom Hanks, and the count of their appearances.
* `WHERE` clause filters out any actors who have the same name as the director.
* `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results in descending order based on the count of appearances.
