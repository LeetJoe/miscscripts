```
Explanation:

* `MATCH` clause finds the paths from an actor to a movie and then to a director, using the `ACTED_IN` and `DIRECTED` relationships. The director's name is restricted to "Tom Hanks".
* `RETURN` clause specifies the output, which includes the list of actors (excluding Tom Hanks) who have appeared in the same movies as Tom Hanks, and the count of their appearances.
* `WHERE` clause filters out any actors who have the same name as the director.
* `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results in descending order based on the count of appearances.

### LLM output
MATCH (a:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(b:Actor)
WHERE a.name = 'Tom Hanks' AND b.name = 'Tom Cruise'
RETURN a.name AS actor1, m.title AS movie1, b.name AS actor2, m.title AS movie2

MATCH (d:Director)-[:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)
WHERE d.name IN ['Tom Hanks', 'Tom Cruise']
RETURN d.name AS director, m.title AS movie

MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN|:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name IN ['Tom Hanks', 'Tom Cruise']
