Tom Hanks是谁？
### LLM output
MATCH (a:Actor {name:'Tom Hanks'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie) RETURN a.name, m.title, m.released, m.year, m.imdbRating

### query
Cloud Atlas是什么电影？

### query
告诉我10个人的名字。
### LLM output
Here's a possible Cypher query that should return the names of 10 people who have acted in or directed movies:
```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN|:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)
RETURN p.name
LIMIT 10
```
This query matches all people (using the `Person` label) who have either acted in or directed movies (using the `ACTED_IN` or `DIRECTED` relationships), and returns their names. The `LIMIT 10` clause limits the number of results returned to 10.

### query
与Kevin Bacon在1～4步之内相关联的不同节点有哪些？
### LLM output
Here's a possible Cypher query that should answer the user's question:
```cypher
MATCH p = (a:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN*1..4]->(m:Movie)
RETURN distinct nodes(p)
```
Explanation:

* `MATCH` clause specifies the pattern we want to match in the graph. In this case, we're looking for paths that start with an actor node (`a:Actor`) and end with a movie node (`m:Movie`), with up to 4 hops in between. The `*` symbol indicates that we want to match any number of nodes between 1 and 4.
* `DISTINCT NODES` clause returns only the distinct nodes in the matching path. This is important because we don't want to include duplicate nodes in the result set.

Note that this query assumes that the relationship between actors and movies is represented by the `ACTED_IN` relationship. If the relationships are represented differently in your schema, you'll need to adjust the query accordingly.

### query
从Kevin Bacon到Meg Ryan之间的最短路径是什么？
### LLM output
PATH FROM Kevin Bacon TO Meg Ryan OF SHORTEST PATH length WHERE NOT (Type:ACTED_IN OR Type:DIRECTED)

EXPLANATION:

* We start by specifying the starting node (Kevin Bacon) and the ending node (Meg Ryan).
* We use the `PATH` function to find the shortest path between the two nodes.
* We specify that we want to exclude any relationships that are not of type `ACTED_IN` or `DIRECTED`. This is because we only want to consider paths that involve actors and directors, and not any other types of relationships.
* The `WHERE` clause filters out any paths that contain a non-empty sequence of nodes that are not of type `ACTED_IN` or `DIRECTED`. This ensures that we only get paths that go from an actor to a movie, or from a director to a movie.
* Finally, we use the `length` property to get the length of the shortest path, which gives us the number of hops required to go from Kevin Bacon to Meg Ryan.

### query
Tom Hanks出演过的电影里的所有演员里，曾与他们在同一部电影中合作演出过的演员（不包括Tom Hanks）的演员名字以及每个人的参演次数是多少？结果按参演次数倒序排列。
### LLM output
Here's a possible Cypher query that should solve the problem:
```cypher
MATCH (a:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(b:Actor)
WHERE a.name = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN b.name, COUNT(m) AS num_movies
ORDER BY num_movies DESC;
```
Explanation:

* `MATCH` finds all movies (`m`) that have an actor (`a`) with name `'Tom Hanks'` who has acted in them. The `-[:ACTED_IN]->` part matches the relationship between the actor and the movie.
* `<-[:ACTED_IN]-(b:Actor)` finds all actors (`b`) who have also acted in the same movies as `a`. The `<-[:ACTED_IN]` part matches the inverse of the `ACTED_IN` relationship.
* `WHERE` filters out any movies or actors that don't match the condition.
* `RETURN` returns the names of the actors (`b.name`) and the count of movies they have acted in (`COUNT(m)`).
* `ORDER BY` sorts the results by the number of movies descending.

Note: This assumes that there is no edge case where two actors have the same name, and that the `name` property of the `Actor` node is unique. If this is not the case, additional filtering may be needed to ensure correct results.

### query
既参演了Tom Hanks出演过的电影，又参演了Tom Cruise出演过的电影的演员，他们的名字、与Tom Hanks合作的电影的名字、与Tom Cruise合作的电影的名字分别是什么？
### LLM output
Here's a possible Cypher query that could answer the user's question:
```cypher
MATCH (a:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(d:Director)
WHERE a.name IN ['Tom Hanks', 'Tom Cruise'] AND m.title IN ['Forrest Gump', 'Jerry Maguire']
RETURN a.name, m.title, d.name;
```
Explanation:

* `MATCH` clause matches actors who have acted in movies directed by Tom Hanks or Tom Cruise.
* `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include actors who have acted in movies with titles 'Forrest Gump' or 'Jerry Maguire'.
* `RETURN` clause returns the names of the actors, the titles of the movies they acted in, and the names of the directors who directed those movies.
